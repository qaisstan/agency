The website must be written in JavaScript (not TypeScript) and strictly follow the folder and component structure defined in the filetree file. Use the detailed layout, design, and content guidelines provided in the draft.md file. The website should offer a sleek, modern design that is fully optimized for mobile devices, SEO-friendly, and conversion-focused. Seamlessly integrate Stripe for payments, Google Workspace for professional email communication, and Google Analytics for user behavior tracking to enhance insights and performance.
