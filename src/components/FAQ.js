      question: "How do your monthly retainer plans work?",
      answer:
        "Our retainer plans are designed for long-term success. Start with a 14-day trial to experience our expertise firsthand. Both plans include dedicated support, regular optimizations, and transparent reporting. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel at any time with 30 days' notice.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer trials for standalone services?",
      answer:
        "While our standalone services don't include trials due to their project-based nature, we offer a free consultation to discuss your needs and provide a detailed scope of work. Our 14-day trial is exclusively available for monthly retainer plans to demonstrate our ongoing value.",
    },
    {
      question: "What makes your agency different?",
      answer:
        "We focus exclusively on Shopify stores and take a data-driven approach to growth. Unlike other agencies, we don't just build â€“ we optimize, test, and iterate based on real user behavior and analytics. Our proven track record shows an average 40% increase in conversion rates for our retainer clients.",
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can I expect results?",
      answer:
        "While every store is unique, our retainer clients typically see initial improvements within the first month. Significant results often emerge within 2-3 months as we implement and optimize our strategies. We provide detailed monthly reports to track progress and ROI.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens after I sign up?",
      answer:
        "You'll immediately receive access to our client portal and schedule an onboarding call. We'll conduct a thorough store audit, set up tracking, and create a 90-day optimization roadmap. Our team then begins implementing improvements based on data-driven priorities.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need help outside of business hours?",
      answer:
        "Growth Accelerator clients receive priority support with extended hours. For urgent issues, we maintain an emergency contact system. All clients have access to our support portal for non-urgent requests and documentation.",
